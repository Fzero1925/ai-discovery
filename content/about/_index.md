AI Discovery tracks news, tools, and robotics developments for teams that need reliable signal without marketing fluff. The site is maintained by a distributed editorial group that mixes industry research with hands-on testing so that every briefing explains what changed and why it matters.

## What We Stand For

- **Fact-first reporting** - every news item links back to primary, trustworthy sources.
- **Practical analysis** - long-form guides dig into workflows, implementation details, and limitations instead of surface-level feature lists.
- **Reader experience** - we keep layouts fast, distraction-free, and focused on value instead of intrusive ads.

## How the Site Runs

- Content is written in Markdown and built with Hugo for predictable, static deployments.
- Vercel provides the delivery network so pages load quickly from any region.
- Google AdSense and carefully selected affiliate partners fund future coverage without changing the reader price.

## Editorial Standards

1. Every article lists its publish date, update date, and editor or author.
2. Images must have the correct usage rights and descriptive `alt` text.
3. Guidance clearly distinguishes opinion from verifiable facts and testing notes.
4. Reader feedback is encouraged; we adjust articles when new information becomes available.
