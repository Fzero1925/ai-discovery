Welcome to the AI Discovery robotics hub. We curate the latest developments, case studies, and practical adoption guides across the robotics landscape. Use the anchors below to jump directly to the segment that matches your focus.

- [Industrial Robotics](#industrial-robotics) — factory automation, cobots, production analytics.
- [Service Robotics](#service-robotics) — logistics, healthcare, hospitality, consumer services.
- [Research & Emerging Tech](#research-emerging-tech) — labs, humanoids, experimental platforms.

## Industrial Robotics {#industrial-robotics}

Explore deployments in manufacturing, warehousing, and heavy industry. Upload news briefings or long-form analyses to `content/robot/industrial/` (create the folder if it does not exist) and Hugo will automatically list them here.

## Service Robotics {#service-robotics}

Track robotics that interact with people or deliver services. Store articles in `content/robot/service/` to keep the section organised.

## Research & Emerging Tech {#research-emerging-tech}

Cover frontier innovation such as humanoid robotics, telepresence, and R&D breakthroughs. Save Markdown files to `content/robot/research/` so they roll up under this segment.

> Tip: Every Markdown file should include descriptive front matter (`title`, `date`, `categories`, `tags`, `featured_image`, `image_alt`) to maintain SEO consistency across the site.
