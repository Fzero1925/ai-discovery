AI Discovery includes affiliate links in some long-form articles. If you choose to purchase through those links, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.

## How We Choose Partners

- We work with companies that ship credible AI products and maintain a history of responsible updates.
- Reviews are written from hands-on testing and editorial standards; commission terms do not change our conclusions.
- Every recommendation is reviewed by the editorial team to confirm it serves reader needs.

## Staying Transparent

- Pages with affiliate relationships include a clear disclosure near the top of the article.
- When a partner changes pricing or product details, we update or remove the link.
- Questions about any affiliate placement can be sent to `affiliate@aidiscovery.com`.
