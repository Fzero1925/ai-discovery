This privacy policy explains what data AI Discovery collects, how we use it, and the choices you have. The site is designed for a global audience and monetised through advertising and affiliate programs.

## Data We Collect

1. **Server logs** - anonymised IP addresses, browser type, and timestamps to maintain security and performance.
2. **Cookies** - primarily from Google AdSense and Google Analytics to measure engagement and deliver relevant ads.
3. **Voluntary submissions** - information you provide when contacting us via email.

## How We Use Data

- Monitor uptime, diagnose issues, and improve site performance.
- Understand which topics resonate so we can prioritise future coverage.
- Deliver contextual advertising and track compliance requirements.
- Respond to support, media, or partnership enquiries.

## Third Parties

We use Google AdSense and, when enabled, Google Analytics. These providers may place their own cookies and follow their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing those policies for details on opt-out options.

## Retention and Security

- Server logs are retained for up to 12 months.
- Email conversations are kept only as long as needed to resolve the request or meet legal obligations.
- We apply reasonable technical and organisational measures, but no internet transmission is completely secure.

## Children

AI Discovery is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect their personal information. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, contact us so we can delete it promptly.

## Policy Updates

We may update this policy to reflect legal or business changes. The latest revision date is shown at the top of this page.
