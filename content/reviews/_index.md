- **Use cases first** ?filter by categories such as productivity, marketing, data, or development to jump straight to what matters.
- **Clear expectations** ?front matter highlights pricing notes, free trial availability, and three headline capabilities for quick scanning.
- **Practical takeaways** ?every guide ends with adoption tips, integration considerations, and caveats discovered during testing.
